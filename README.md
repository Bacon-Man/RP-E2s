# RP-E2s
Expression 2s for Roleplay in Garry's Mod (Specifically SRH)

### Libraries
The default library location is in the /lib folder. Make sure to place the libraries in that folder.
This allows all other libraries and E2s I make to easily be added and used.
Every library requires the updater library to check for updates.
The updater library can be disabled in other E2s by commenting out the '#include "lib/update"' and the 'setVersion' function.
